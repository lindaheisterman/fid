<h2><b>Low and Slow</b></h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is <b>precisely</b> set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book <b>Cooking for Geeks</b>, Jeff Porter describes it as <cite><q>"ultra-low-temperature poaching"</cite></q>.<p>
<p> Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollaindaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30" November 30, 2016</time></p>
