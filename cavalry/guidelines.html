<p>The following information serves as a guide through the application process.</p>
<h3>Initial Application</h3>
<p>Please allow 4-6 weeks for your initial application to be reviewed. Due to high demand, the review process may take up to 8 weeks before we can contact applicants regarding their status.
 Our team carefully evaluates each application and makes a collective decision. Applicants will be notified of acceptance or denial to proceed with the next steps. On average, the entire application process takes 4-6 months.
<br><em>Please note that Canine Cavalry reserves the right to terminate the application process at any stage if necessary based on the review findings.</em></p>
<h3>Formal Application Packet</h3>
<p>Once an applicantâ€™s initial application is reviewed and accepted, they will be contacted by email or phone. A formal application packet will be sent via email, which must be completed in full for processing.</p>
<p>During this phase, the applicant is required to submit:
    <ul>
      <li>A detailed and completed formal applcation form</li>
      <li>Completed support person application form</li>
      <li>A short (1-2 paragraph) autobiography</li>
      <li>Recent photos of the applicant and their support person</li>
      <li>DD-214 Form</li>
      <li>Completed reference form(s) from a licensed medical doctor and/or a licensed mental health professional</li>
      <li>Current photos of the applicant's home</li>
      <li>Proof of residency</li>
      <li>Proof of financial ability to care for a dog.</li>
</p>
<p>Note that Canine Cavalry partners with several entities across the country to assist those financially unable to support a companion dog. Information will be provided to all applicants if the need is identified.</p>
<p>A virtual interview will be scheduled with the applicant and support person once the formal application has been reviewed (a 4-6 week process on average)</p>
<h3>Virtual Interview</h3>
<p>The applicant and support person will be contacted to schedule a virtual interview.  Both parties must be present at the same interview.  Expect this interview to last an hour on average.  This is the time to ask questions or voice any concerns you may have.  
    Once the interview is complete, our team will meet and make a decision for canine placement.  The applicant will be contacted and notified if the application process is moving forward or if the process ends here.</p>     
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>If the formal application and virtual interview are successful, the applicant and support person will move forward in queue for the next available training slot in their region.  
   Training facilities are located in Florida, Texas, Ohio, and California.  It is the financial responsibility of the applicant and support person to cover their travel and food cost while at the three-week training.  Canine Cavalry has an onsite dormitory at each training center (12 person capacity) that includes a kitchen and bathroom/shower area.  A dormitory room is provided free of charge to all applicants and support persons during the three-week training program.</p>

    <li>Week 2: Meet your companion!  This week you are partnered with your companion dog and you will start hands-on training</li>
    <li>Week 3: More Training, including field trips to learn how to manage a companion dog in various settings</li>

    <li>Months 1-3: You will be required to attend one monthly weekend training session (one full day) at your nearest training facility for continued training and evaluation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
During your first week of training your team (you, your support person, and your companion dog) will be assigned to a Canine Cavalry counselor who will continue to follow-up with you after training.  You may contact this counselor at any time if questions or concerns arise.  You will be required to check in with this team member once every three months - this will be the time to provide updates, ask questions, seek advise or additional support.  We are here to help! You will be required to submit all annual vet records (vaccines, surgeries, issues, etc) to Canine Cavalry.</p>  

<h3><em>Canine Calvary maintains ownership of all graduate dogs until the time of retirement.</em></h3>
<p>This ensures that we can step in to provide support in the event that the veteran and/or support person is not able to care for the dog on a temporary or long-term basis. A Canine Calvary dog serves his veteran until the age of seven, at which time, the veteran has the option to adopt the dog from Canine Cavalry or the dog will be placed with an approved family in the Canine Cavalry adoption division.</p>
