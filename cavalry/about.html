    <p> Sergeant Ethan Carter returned home after three tours of duty, but the battle wasn’t over. The war followed him into civilian life, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t shake the constant weight of anxiety and isolation. The transition was harder than he ever imagined. 
        At the suggestion of a friend, Ethan met with Dr. Olivia Greene, a compassionate veterinarian who understood the power of service dogs. She suggested a service dog could help him face the daily struggles of reintegrating into civilian life. Skeptical at first, Ethan soon realized the difference a trained dog could make.
        With Scout, a calm yellow Lab, by his side, Ethan felt the weight lift. Scout became more than just a companion—he became a lifeline. The bond they shared inspired Ethan to team up with Dr. Greene and John Hayes, a businessman passionate about supporting veterans, to create Canine Cavalry. Together, they founded a nonprofit to provide service dogs to veterans dealing with PTSD, anxiety, and other conditions.
        At Canine Cavalry, the mission is clear: no veteran should face their battles alone. Every dog partnered with a veteran is more than just a helper—they’re a steadfast ally, helping veterans regain independence, find peace, and rebuild their lives, one day at a time.</p>

<p> Canine Cavalry companion dogs are bred through our Canine Cavalry breeding program and are raised for the first 12 months of their lives with a volunteer "puppy parent", where they learn basic tasks and how to socialize in private and public settings. At the age of 12-16 months the puppy is then transferred to a regional trainign center, where he receives additional training and evaluation for six to nine months to master advanced skills.  By the end of the program, a Canine Cavalry companion dog is trained to master up to 45 tasks, offering optimal support for their veteran partner.</p>

<h3>Why <em>Canine Cavalry?</em></h3>
<p>The name Canine Cavalry reflects the steadfast strength and unwavering support our service dogs provide to those in need. Historically, a cavalry represents a powerful force that rides to the aid of others, often in times of critical need. While our team’s companions are dogs rather than horses, their mission parallels the cavalry's purpose: to bring strength, relief, and resilience to challenging situations.
   Our service dogs embody loyalty, courage, and dependability—qualities that serve as a lifeline for veterans facing physical, emotional, or psychological challenges. Through their unique training and unconditional companionship, these dogs become more than helpers; they are partners in overcoming adversity.</p>
