    <h1>Canine Cavalry</h1>
    <h2>Unleashing Loyalty, Strength, and Daily Support for Our Heroes</h2>
    <p>After serving their country with unwavering dedication, many veterans return home carrying invisible wounds—physical, mental, and emotional scars that linger long after their service. The battles they face don’t end on the battlefield; they continue in the quiet moments, in sleepless nights, and in navigating the challenges of daily life. That’s where Canine Cavalry steps in. Our mission is to provide more than just a trained service dog; we offer a steadfast companion—a lifeline of support, loyalty, and strength. These remarkable dogs are not just helpers; they are partners, guiding veterans through moments of anxiety, physical limitations, and emotional trials. Together, they form an unbreakable bond, enabling our heroes to regain independence, find peace, and rediscover purpose. At Canine Cavalry, we believe no veteran should face their battles alone.</p>
