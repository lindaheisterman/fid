<h1>Writing</h1>

<h2>Writing and editing are the lifeblood of meaningful communication, weaving together ideas and emotions into a tapestry that connects us.</h2> 
<p style="text-align: left;"><br>From the lyrics of a heartfelt song to the compelling narrative of a novel, every carefully chosen word has the power to move, inspire, and inform. 
Editing sharpens these expressions, ensuring clarity and resonance, whether in a detailed article, persuasive ad copy, or the raw creativity of a script or poem. 
These processes transcend mere technical skill; they are acts of artistry and empathy, bridging gaps and forging connections that resonate across cultures, generations, and hearts.</p>


<h2>Written copy introducing a new album entitled <em>Awakenings</em></h2>
<p class="highlight">There comes a turning point in life where we begin to touch a reality that we have yet to experience. Secret truths and hidden things suddenly come into view.  Fragments are pieced together.  Lies are chiseled away to expose the truth that is within.  We awaken out of our dream state into a reality that fills every aspect of our being.  We awaken to who we are.  We awaken to what is real.  We awaken to a brand new day.</p>

    <p class="highlight">The <em>Awakenings</em> album is a collection of original songs about love, letting go, forgiveness, growth, reality, illusion, and life - all experiences leading to an "awakening" to what is real, what is important, and what remains.
