<h1>Mural Design</h1>

<h2>The Mural Design Process</h2>
<p>Murals are a unique form of artistry that convey powerful, unspoken messages, uniting and inspiring the community. The process starts with a creative brief, outlining the vision and goals, which is reviewed and approved before the mural is created, ensuring it aligns with the communityâ€™s values and message.</p>
